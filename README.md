# Passive Commutator

A low-torque ten channel slip ring commutator for small animal electrophysiology. Suitable for use with [Intan](http://intantech.com/) headstages and [Open-Ephys](http://www.open-ephys.org/).

Inspired by [Micco 1977](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0361-9230%2877%2990060-0), this commutator uses a a two piece slip ring system from Moog, Inc. For a list of parts see the [bill of materials](bill-of-materials.csv).

This system was developed by Daniel Baleckaitis, Kyler Brown, and Graham Fetterman in Dan Margoliash's lab.

## 3D printing
The two pieces, [base.STL](base.STL) and [wall.STL](wall.STL) are known to print correctly on a [MakerBot Replicator 2](http://store.makerbot.com/replicator2.html). The units are millimeters.

## Assembly

(TODO)
